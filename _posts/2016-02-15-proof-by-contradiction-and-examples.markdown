Given a set of premises S, a proposition P, and a contradiction F, the proof by contradiction is represented as: 

S U {not P} [= F implies S [= P

## Example

Prove that there is no greatest even integer.

Suppose that the proposition is false, i.e. there is greatest even integer N. We then need to show a contradiction. 

There is greatest even integer N <==> for every even integer n, N >= n. 

Now, suppose M = N + 2. Then, M is also an even and M > N (because M = N + 2). Hence, this contradicts the supposition that N >= n for all even integers. 

Hence, the supposition is false and the statement *there is no greatest even integer* is true.

This completes the proof.

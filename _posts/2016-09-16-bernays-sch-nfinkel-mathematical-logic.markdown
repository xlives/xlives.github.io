The **Bernays–Schönfinkel** is a decidable fragment of first-order logic formulas, in prenex *\forsome^* \forall^** (not contain function symbols).

This class of logic is called *effectively propositional (EPR)* since it can be *effectively* translated into propositional logic formulas by a process of grounding or instantiation.
